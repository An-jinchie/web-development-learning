🌐 What is the Internet?
The Internet is a global network that connects millions of computers and devices. 
It allows people to share information, communicate, and access data instantly. 
You could think of it as a giant web of connected roads where data travels back and forth.

⚙️ How does the Internet work?
When a website is visited, your device sends a request to a server using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). 
That server sends the website data back, and your browser displays it. 
It’s more or less like sending a letter and getting a response almost instantly.

What is a Domain Name?
A domain name is the readable address of a website, like "www.google.com". 
It’s linked to an IP (Internet Protocol) address (like a home address for computers).
This makes it easier for people to find and access websites on the internet.

🌍 DNS and How It Works
DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names into IP addresses. 
When you type “facebook.com”, DNS finds the actual server’s IP so your computer knows where to go.
It functions like a phone book for the internet, using a hierarchical system of servers to find the correct IP address for a requested domain, which then allows your browser to connect to the correct server and load the website.

🧭 Browsers and How They Work
Browsers (like Chrome or Firefox) fetch, process, and display web pages. 
They understand code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render what you see visually.

How Browsers Work.
- You enter a website address (URL) or click a link.
- The browser sends a request to the website’s server.
- The server responds by sending the webpage’s data (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.).
- The browser processes this data and displays the webpage.
- You can interact with the page by clicking, scrolling, or entering information.

💬 What are Markup Languages?
A markup language is a text-encoding system which specifies the structure and formatting of a document and potentially the relationships among its parts. 
Markup can control the display of a document or enrich its content to facilitate automated processing.
Markup languages (like HTML) use tags to structure and describe content on the web. 
Example: `<h1>Hello World</h1>` displays a large heading on a webpage.

What is Front-End Development?
Front-end development focuses on what users see and interact with. 
It includes HTML (structure), CSS (style), and JavaScript (functionality).  
Example: When you click a button and it changes color — that’s front-end work.

🌐 What is HTTP?
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the communication system that allows data to move between browsers and servers.  
Example: When you type a URL and press enter, your browser sends an HTTP request.

What is a Browser?
A browser is a software application that allows you to access and view websites on the internet. 
It retrieves web pages, displays text, images, and videos, and lets you interact with online content. 
Examples include Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox.

How Do Browsers Work?
Browsers render web pages by interpreting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
They also handle caching, cookies, and security to keep your browsing smooth.
When you enter a website address (URL) or click a link, the browser sends a request to the website’s server.
The server responds by sending the webpage’s data (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.).
The browser then processes this data and displays the webpage.
You can interact with the page by clicking, scrolling, or entering information.

🕸️ How Does the Web Work?
The web is a collection of websites stored on servers and accessed through browsers over the Internet. 
It’s built on protocols like HTTP and secured versions like HTTPS.
