🎯 My Web Development Goals for the Year

- Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript deeply.
- Understand how to build and design responsive, beautiful websites.
- Learn Git and GitHub for version control.
- Contribute to at least one open-source project.
- Build a personal portfolio website by the end of the year.
- Gain confidence working with APIs and frameworks like React.

🌟 I expect to look back at this file in December and smile, knowing how far I’ve come.
